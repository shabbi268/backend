# This is the Backend part of the Posts App where users can CREATE/UPDATE/DELETE/VIEW the posts.
I used Express to create a server and developed CRUD routes to be consumed by Frontend.
Created a MongoDB cluster on Mongo Atlas and created a database and made use of the cloud URL.
# Please find the frontend part of the project [HERE](https://github.com/shabbi268/posts-frontend)

# steps to start the project
to install all the dependency packages run:
### npm install

to start the backend API:
### npm start 

the .env file has the MongoDB atlas URI for connecting to the database and the port number where the application will be running
